I"“<p>I had a few goals this year which revolved around arranging my schedule to align with my values. In order to see through this success, I spent a lot of time offilne to give everything a solid college try. Iâ€™ve learned a lot. Specifically, Iâ€™ve learned what itâ€™s like to feel like your heart has been broken one million times over.</p>

<p>Quite recently I stumbled upon this podcast episode which put into words some of my thoughts about this experience and have highlighted my favourite portions below:</p>

<strong>The Pursuit of Happyness and choosing the right director for it</strong><br />

<p>Without boring everyone with the mundanity of my current life, my big take-away from this year: itâ€™s par for the course to be heartbroken over all the minor and major disappointments of your life. Itâ€™s not okay to get stuck on them though. Leaving the rest to Dolly,</p>

  <p>You better stop whining, pining
Get your dreams in line
And then just shine, design, refine
Until they come true</p>
