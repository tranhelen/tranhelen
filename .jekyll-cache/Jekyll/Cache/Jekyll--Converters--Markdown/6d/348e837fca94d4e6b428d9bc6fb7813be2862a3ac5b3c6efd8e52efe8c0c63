I"¸
<p>I had a few goals this year which revolved around arranging my schedule to align with my values. In order to see through this success I spent a lot of time offilne to give everything a solid college try. I‚Äôve learned a lot. Specifically, I know intimately what it‚Äôs like to have your heart break one million times over.</p>

<p>Quite recently I stumbled upon this podcast episode which put into words some of my thoughts about this year (and the past recent years of my life) and have highlighted my favourite portions below:</p>

<strong>Rise of loneliness and loss of community</strong><br />
We are being over-stimulated and surrounding constantly by things which make us happy. This makes it easy for us to shut other people out which further drives us into loneliness. He theorizes this gives birth to ‚Äúoutrage culture‚Äù.<span class="cite"><a href="#note-1" name="back-1">1</a></span> We become calcified to welcoming new ideas and this makes us unlikely to create the relationships to get out of loneliness.</li>

<strong>Happiness is found in self-confrontation and discomfort</strong><br />
We all need challenges: mental or physical.</li>

<strong>The Pursuit of Happyness and choosing the right director for it</strong><br />
‚ÄúAmericans can‚Äôt see what the American Dream actually is.‚Äù</li>

<strong>The illusion of logic</strong><br />
We think we all make logical decisions but the majority of our problems stem from our emotional issues. The ‚Äòfeeling brain‚Äô is driving if you‚Äôre not self-aware that you can control your experience. If you can‚Äôt get yourself to work-out, it‚Äôs not that you don‚Äôt have the right plan: you have an emotional problem.</li>

<p>My big take-away from this year: it‚Äôs okay to be heartbroken over all the minor and major disappointments of your life. It‚Äôs not okay to get stuck on them though. Leaving the rest to Dolly,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You better stop whining, pining<br />
Get your dreams in line<br />
And then just shine, design, refine<br />
Until they come true</p>
