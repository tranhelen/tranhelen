I"·<p>Itâ€™s hard to summarize what youâ€™ve learned after you travel to seven continents and host hundreds of travellers in your own home. Iâ€™ve been asked, â€œwhat did you get out of all this?â€ and have had a hard time describing it until I read this from a book by by Christopher Hitchens which succinctly describes my biggest lesson,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In one way, travelling has narrowed my mind. What I have discovered is something very ordinary and unexciting, which is that humans are the same everywhere and that the degree of variation between members of our species is very slight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Itâ€™s as accurate as can be: I find a comfort in the unexciting discoveryâ€¦ drawing from it a special compassion built over years of observation. Weâ€™re all kind of the same. Like Hitchens, I believe it to be banal.</p>

<p>If you want to make it interesting, you have to learn how to identify and love the tiny differences.</p>
