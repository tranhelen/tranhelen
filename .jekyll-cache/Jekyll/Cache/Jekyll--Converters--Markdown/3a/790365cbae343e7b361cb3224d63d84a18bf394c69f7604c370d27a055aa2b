I"t<p>I haven’t been secret about this year being difficult for me: I placed a lot of emphasis on my goals and staying home. It was a year of bedding patience: how long does it take to change the way you eat? the way you train? to build muscle? to fall in love? to build a community at home? to study for a university exam? to build an app? a company? And after all that was being answered, my pièce de résistance, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3RvdWXAzWR/">figure out what is up with Texas?</a></p>

<p>This all takes than you think (especially figuring out Texas) and what you find hard is going to come easy while you struggle with things you <a href="http://helentran.com/theotherharderstuff">never</a> <a href="http://helentran.com/IAPandapple">accounted</a> <a href="http://helentran.com/onemillionheartbreaks">for</a>.</p>

<p>This coming year my intention is to focus on my main goals: build my company and my physique. The rest will fall where it will and I intent to simply observe and see what happens. I’m feeling good about 2020 though: we’re going to be profitable and I’m going to take home first.</p>
