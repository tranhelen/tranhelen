I"ö<p>You sink ten years of your life into your career and you feel stretched. At the end of the decade you look back and you say to yourself, â€œWell, that didnâ€™t need to be so stressful,â€ and so thatâ€™s what you tell people entering the industry: chill out, work less, itâ€™s going to be okay. <em>Find work-life balance.</em></p>

<p>I feel a little bit irresponsible when I tell people that because itâ€™s not really what I want to say.</p>

<hr class="--small" />

<p>I want to tell them I went through a deep depression and then was told I had been  <em>chronically depressed since childhood</em>â€“25 years. I want to tell them I burned out a couple times. I want to tell them Iâ€™ve said things to people I deeply regret and acted poorly in times when it wasnâ€™t called for because I was so stressed.</p>

<p>But then I want to tell them the most important, bittersweet, part: it all had to happen to become a better colleague. Some years I needed to work sixteen hours in a day week-after-week, or have my heart broken and try not to cry in meetings, or become involved in an abusive relationship, or fear for my safety in a foreign country, or build a product I didnâ€™t care for.</p>

<p>All of that needed to happen at the time that it did, in the order that it did, and no one could have ever saved me from it with a few well-meaning phrases. While most of the events happened outside of work, it undoubtedly changed everything about me at work.</p>

<p>So, what do I think about seeking work-life balance? It likely wonâ€™t come in the controlled way you seek.</p>

<hr class="--small" />

<p>Thereâ€™s a biological term we talk about often during our conditioning phase of competition called â€˜<em>homeostasis</em>.â€™ Itâ€™s an unescapable rule of the body: itâ€™s always attempting to find whatâ€™s optimal for you using your built-in regulatory mechanisms. If you eat less, itâ€™ll make you hungry so you can eat again.</p>

<p>I bring this up because I canâ€™t help but believe two things which are seemingly at odds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You donâ€™t have to work yourself to death</li>
  <li>The time I spent working myself to death gave me a leg-up and paved the way for the rest of my career</li>
</ul>

<p>The work hours I pulled off in my early 20s <em>were</em> balanced. I needed nothing else at the time. My career was my escape from an otherwise dull life and my body and mind responded by giving me the energy I needed to pull it off. When that was no longer the case, my body revolted to bring me back to normal. Always in balance.</p>

<p>When I look back, Iâ€™m looking back through my <em>current context</em> and so I say, â€œyou donâ€™t need to work so hard.â€ But thatâ€™s only because it would throw my life off-balance <em>now</em>â€¦ I have different priorities.</p>

<p>My point is: balance is a scale on your own open sea. No one else can tell which way the winds will blow or how rough itâ€™ll be out there. You have to listen to your intuition and look out for yourself.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s what I really want to say.</p>
