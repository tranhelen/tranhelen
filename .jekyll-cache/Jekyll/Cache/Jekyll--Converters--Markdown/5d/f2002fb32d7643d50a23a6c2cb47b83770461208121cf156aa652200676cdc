I"ã<p>Have you tried to write one of these before? Theyâ€™re <a href="http://helentran.com/fouryearsoflessons">timestamps of your life</a> and can be a great way to remind yourself to be grateful for what has happened and what will happen.</p>

<p>I havenâ€™t been secret about this year being difficult for me: I placed a lot of emphasis on my goals. It was a year of bedding patience: how long does it take to change the way you eat? the way you train? to build muscle? to fall in love? to build local relationships? to study for a university exam? an app? a company?</p>

<p>The answer to all of it: longer than you think and what you find hard is going to come easy while you struggle with things you never accounted for.</p>
