I"ı<p>I really love this whole idea of <em>â€œif you build it, they will come,â€</em> or that other similar phrase, <em>â€œjust build a good product.â€</em> Itâ€™s a fantasy though. It sounds nice but it doesnâ€™t ring true for most human relationships. How does someone know you exist unless you show up?</p>

<p>I spent a few months talking to different people in the beauty industry for Jupiter and interviewing them before one line of code was written. Jupiterâ€™s original specâ€™d out features are still being built and weâ€™re one year out from our official full-time starting date.</p>

<p>In the meantime, weâ€™ve been building out an email list through a website, Instagram engagement, and Facebook ads. At the end of March, here were our stats:</p>

<table class="stats">
<tr>
    <td><strong>Leads</strong></td>
    <td>1175<span class="cite"><a href="#note-1" name="back-1">1</a></span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><strong>Facebook spend</strong></td>
    <td>$5952.46 (CAD)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><strong>Cost per Lead</strong></td>
    <td>$5.06</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Most recently weâ€™ve decided to start pre-selling our subscriptions and as of today weâ€™ve sold 10 pre-paid annual subscriptions. Weâ€™re officially <strong>post revenue</strong> and all of the sales came from the non-product related work we were doing: telling people.</p>

<p>If I had let myself believe, <em>â€œif you build it, they will come,â€</em> we could have languished in product build mode before finding out if anyone was going to pay for it. With our run-rate this could have put us in a very dangerous position. If anything, I wish we had done this sooner.</p>

<p>They didnâ€™t â€œcomeâ€ in the magical sort of way entrepreneur-optimism wants but they gave us money to continue building and itâ€™s a welcomed light signal to receive in the midst of start-up darkness. Over the next three-six months our metrics may be able to tell us how viable this business really is.</p>

  <p>As you build it, tell people to come.</p>
