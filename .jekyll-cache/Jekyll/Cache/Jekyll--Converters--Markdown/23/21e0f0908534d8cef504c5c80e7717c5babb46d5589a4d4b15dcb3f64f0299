I"F<p>I had a few goals this year which revolved around arranging my schedule to align with my values. In order to see through this success I spent a lot of time offilne to give everything a solid college try. I’ve learned a lot. Specifically, I know intimately what it’s like to have your heart break one million times over.</p>

<p>Quite recently I stumbled upon this podcast episode which put into words some of my thoughts about this year (and the previous four years) and have highlighted  portions below:</p>

<strong>Rise of loneliness and loss of community</strong><br />
We are being over-stimulated and surrounding constantly by things which make us happy. This makes it easy for us to shut other people out. Mark Manson theorizes this gave birth to “outrage culture”.<span class="cite"><a href="#note-1" name="back-1">1</a></span> We became calcified to welcoming new ideas and this makes us unlikely to create the relationships to get out of the loneliness.</li>

<strong>Happiness is found in self-confrontation and discomfort</strong><br />
We all need challenges: mental or physical. This aligns with my experience with <a href="http://helentran.com/hardworkandplay">resilience and self-efficacy.</a> “Life is not about getting rid of your problems, it’s trying to get better problems.”</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">68:15</code><br />
<strong>The Pursuit of Happyness and choosing the right director for it</strong><br />
“Americans can’t see what the American Dream actually is.”</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">69:20</code><br />
<strong>The illusion of logic</strong><br />
We think we all make logical decisions but the majority of our problems stem from our emotional issues. The ‘feeling brain’ is driving if you’re not self-aware that you can control your experience. If you can’t get yourself to work-out, it’s not that you don’t have the right training plan: you have an emotional problem.</li>

<strong>“Discipline equals freedom.”</strong></li>

<p>It’s okay to be heartbroken over all the minor and major disappointments of your life. It’s likely a sign that you are moving in the right direction… just make sure you’re not stuck admiring the heartbreaks. Leaving the rest to Dolly,</p>

  <p>You better stop whining, pining<br />
Get your dreams in line<br />
And then just shine, design, refine<br />
Until they come true</p>
