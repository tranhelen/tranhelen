        <p><a href="http://helentran.com/46-books-later">Last year</a> I re-ignited my love for reading. This time around, I'm highlighting the books that have <em>changed my perspective</em> and some <em>honourable mentions</em>. The rest I've listed for completion sake but I'm not particularly tied to them for any reason.</p>

                <p><b>Crucial Conversations by Collective</b>
                <br>This is a great book for any Designer who is looking for a way to adjust their communication for better results. I found it helpful to reframe some of my hard conversations. Considering rereading this to ensure my application is engrained.</p>

                <p><b>Consider the Lobster by David Foster Wallace</b>
                <br>Another collection of essays by DFW, a couple of which changed the way I look at the presidential campaign in 2016 prior to the election results, the English dictionary wars, <em>white male standard English</em>, and autobiographies written by stars.</p>

                <p><b>But What If We're Wrong? by Chuck Klosterman</b>
                <br>If gravity, something the author believes to be true to the deepest levels of his being, is <em>incorrect</em>, what does that mean?</p>
                <p>This book meandered a bit but the overall argument was interesting. I'm now dedicating more time to proving myself wrong. Although light-hearted, it changed the way I think.</p>

                <p><b>Listen, Liberal by Thomas Frank</b>
                <br>After the election, I went searching for answers. This explains the history of the Democratic party and I felt the results to be more sensical than not in the end.</p>
                <p>I'll be exploring more political books over the next year to develop my understanding better.</p>

                <p><b>Managing Humans by Michael Lopp</b>
                <br>This was an especially trying management year for me; scaling the team at Shopify from 4 > 18 was a challenge. I asked lots of questions.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, though, you don't which questions to ask and ML answered them for me. I <a href="http://helentran.com/paying-attention">wrote about it</a> earlier this year.</p>

                <p><b>The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide by James Fadiman</b>
                <br>I have spent the past little bit of my life exploring alternative therapies and this book led me down a rabbit hole.</p>
                <p>I've run a <a href="http://helentran.com/dates-with-lucy">microdosing experiment</a> because of it and plan to delve deeper into the spiritual realms before deciding whether or not it's made an impact.</p>

                <br/>I've been eating up everything written by Jon Ronson this year, and this was another excellent collection of extraordinary people doing strange things.</p>

                <p class="book-cover"><b>So You've Been Publicly Shamed by Jon Ronson</b>

                <br>This book didn't make the above list because it wasn't <em>as</em> transformative but it was an enjoyable read about the people who we shame on the internet.</p>

                <br>The movie was based on a true story. I never saw the movie, but uh, I'm assuming the book is a bit weirder.</p>

                <p class="book-cover"><b>The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson</b>
                <br/>This was my first foray into JR. You've likely realized by now that I read everything he's written in one year. I recommend his audiobooks over the written ones. His narration is supreme.</p>

                <br>I happened by this book through a very emotional time and it was the first time I had ever found a poet who I made my heart <em>move</em>. There are two other poetry books on my reading list this year because of him.</p>
