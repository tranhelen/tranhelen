Dear Ladies,

Sandberg's book sucks. Let's just start there. The industry is unfair and the odds are stacked against you. Asking you to over-deliver while the industry is under-delivering reeks of privilege and undermines your contribution. 

All that being said, you're still going to have to meet me halfway.

I manage a team of Designers, I taught Design for two years, I speak at schools, and I'm partly responsible for who is hired onto our team. A large portion of the Designers I see/teach/manage are female... we can probably guess why. I've spoken to a lot of you and there's something eerily similar about all these conversations.

<blockquote class="large">
    <p>You're not taking credit for what is actually happening.</p>
</blockquote>

Self-doubt is healthy in doses but be careful what story you are telling yourself. Self-doubt is a mechanism to help you gauge what's _real_ not to over-exaggerate anxieties. Self-doubt is, "_Hmm, I should think about this a little._" not, "_I am terrible at this._" This is many steps too far in the wrong direction.

I ask of you, and these are simply suggestions, to meet me halfway:

- **Put a portfolio up.** Not because you are looking for a job but because you should be proud of your contributions.
- **Share what you're doing.** Allow the other women coming into the industry to see people who resemble them. 
- **Acknowledge yourself.** What you are doing is _actually happening_. Don't give credit where it's not due. Did _we_ do it? Or did _you_ do it?
- **Turn compassion inwards.** If you are practicing, you will get better. It's just going to take time.
- **Drop belittling words.** The value of your contribution is context-dependant, but it shouldn't be affected because _you_ used the word '_just._'
- **Accept compliments.** _Thank you._ Stop speaking.

This shit is cray and I know it's hard... we can work on changing the culture together. Until then, meet me halfway: **do not shrink who you are**.

See you around,  
Helen
