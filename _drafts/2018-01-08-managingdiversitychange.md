When I was working at Shopify, I realized that the team had grown in a direction I wasn't entirely happy with. Our last growth spurt had added a slew of like-candidates which created an off-balanced team. It had taken me a while to realize this as rapid growth has a tendency to override many things in it's path.

Since I had been reading about the topic for the previous year, I thought it was a good opportunity to try to see if I could do something to make a change immediately and set up the team better long-term. After asking a few people, I found some resources and tried to apply new approaches to what our team was doing over six months.

<em><strong>Note:</strong> There were/are multiple people at the past company working on this. My intention is not to criticize the company I worked for nor the people who work there. I wanted to take responsibility for change so I worked on the local team I could affect first. It's also important to note I don't work there anymore so things may have changed by now.</em>

## The Problems

When trying to change the make-up on a team, you're faced with some of the following obstacles (I don't claim that this is close to a full list of the issues regarding this topic:

### Growth and scale

The faster your company is growing, the harder it is to advocate for diversity initiatives because change, generally, takes more time. Since the problem is systemic, it must be met on many levels by all. Changing how you're approaching even one area, like hiring, takes time. This pressure is felt immensely when someone needs to fill a role: the insistence on a slower process makes you look like a inconvienant blocker.

### Education

While diversity research has been around for decades now, the general awareness and understanding level of the average employee is low. Typical topics which come up in conjunction with the phrase _diversity and inclusion_ include: the meritocracy myth, the pipeline problem, lowering the standard, and quotas. Education, a large part of change management, takes an long time with inconsistent feedback loops.

### Leadership

People do better and feel more comfortable in companies in which they can see a least one or two in leadership that are like them. If there are no examples, the current leadership team has to groom someone showing promise early to pre-emptively fill the role when it's required. To make matters more complicated, if the current leadership positions are already taken by the majority, even the most talented of workers may never get a chance.

### Management

If you're in a company that doesn't prioritize management (and with this, training), diversity initiatives will be quickly forgotten amongst the many other 'more important' issues. The sentence, '_this company doesn't have people managers_,' is the biggest sign of a resistant culture and not rare in a world where technical proficiency is preferred other over skill-sets.

The two areas I knew I could best affect was the hiring process for the members on my team and re-evaluating how we dealt with the Paula principle internally. Below is a list of things we re-evaluated.

## Hiring

A lot of these initiatives were put forth by the diversity and inclusion team at Shopify:

### Review outward-facing company marketing

This is one of the easiest adjustments you can make: looking at how your company talks about roles that are available. Wording or image selection can discourage applicants from applying if they come across as heavily biased. If your team is attending events to actively recruit, prime them to use the same inclusion words. Attend a variety of events and pay attention to who you're asking to represent your company.

### Blind portfolios and applications

This was a new initiative I tried for the intern program I worked on. Blinding portfolios or applications takes quite a while, but it helps when paired with pooling candidates. A neutral employee not involved in the hiring process can spend time putting boxes over any identifiers. This helps prevent any biases prior to the interview process.

### Pool candidates

Evaluating candidates within groups can help choose the most qualified person for the job. It protects teams from biases involving personal relationships and removes the easy default–hiring the first qualified person who comes along. This also helps even out the visibility problem PoC and minorities have.

### Choose varied interviewers

Having a diverse team interview candidates helps different people feel more comfortable as it gives them more opportunities to represent their best selves depending on the environment. Consider different dimensions to better assess how they would work with different types of people.

### Isolate group discussions

Each interviewer should feel out their evaluation separately and privately first. Afterwards, have a group discussion with the interviewers comparing all the candidates. Keep the conversation as objective as possible and be on the look-out for phrases which are vague or unclear. Try to actively stem group-thinking with assumptions and keep people's focus on their evaluations written prior to the group meeting.

### Help employees participate

To encourage your employees to refer beyond their friend circles, run diversity sprints encouraging people to add candidates evenly into the pool. PoC and miniorities tend to have less visibility, not less merit, so ask your employees to put in all types of candidates at an even rate (ex: for every man, try to find a woman to add into recruitment). 

### Monitor who is reaching out

Candidates were more likely to respond if the person reaching out was a person like them of their own discipline. Those doing the reach-outs should represent a diverse team, to avoid biases in candidate selection and ensure that candidates feel comfortable. Like recruiting events, prime those who are reaching out with what you're looking for and how to ask the right questions.

### Look beyond the obvious

Lack of visibility is more obvious when hiring for a profession which depends on a portfolio. Through my own research, I found that I could find PoC and miniority candidates but had a hard time locating their portfolios if they were employed. A little more effort into reaching them and asking for what I was looking for greatly increased my chances of success. Often times, it was not that thery weren't qualified, but they feared giving off a sense of disloyalty and/or their projects were protected from being published online. You can even out visibility issues with a bit more effort.

### Be specific with recruiters

Hiring Designers can be difficult because of the subjective nature of judging the craft. Since Designers come with such varied skill-sets, those who are reaching out must be primed with who to look for. _Many people_ judge (and misjudge) portfolios based on visual aesthetic but that is only one of the skill-sets of a well-functioning product team team. Providing a list of clear questions and things for recruiters to look helps guide their search.

## Retention and the Paula Principle

If your leadership team is filled with mostly one group, they've taken the space. This becomes a larger issue as senior ranks become more experienced and the company matures as recognition for work can become more important for retention. If space is taken, it is unlikely that a miniority will be able to move upwards or see a future at the company. As employees tend to look to others like them for examples of success, this tends to have a double-negative effect.

### Clarify expectations

When expectations aren't clear for a role, managers and employees can fill a role via _interpretation_ which isn't an objective way to ensure the most qualified candidates are getting through the funnel. This is one of the reasons why teams can pull without intention in a specific direction. Defaults can be very powerful.

### Open new applications internally first

To counter-act the Paula principle, making choices like using open internal applications for new roles (especially in leadership) gives people an opportunity to express interest without depending solely on their manager. The extra transparency encourages candidates who haven't approached the topic before to consider new career changes without pressure.

### Pay attention in promotion discussions

We did group discussions at Shopify to calibrate and double-check decisions about promotions and hiring. When you're in one of those conversations, listen to those around you to ensure that the way the conversation is framed isn't to bias one group or the other. Ask clarifying questions and challenge possible assumptions being made.

### Identify potential early and groom

If you're in the position to be able to help out a report who has expressed interest in leadership, be transparent about your day-to-day and start early with training. If they show promise and interest, setting them up for success can be a great way to re-balance an unbalanced team. PoCs and minorities tend to have less opportunities than their more visible counterparts and so keeping them top of mind for new 'proving' projects helps them move upwards.

### Plan culture activities for everyone

Feeling unwelcome in their environment is one of the most cited reasons for employees leaving a company. When planning culture activities in the company or across teams, try to pick activities which are varied and more inclusive for everyone. Think about time of day, activity, food, and beverages served for a place to start.

### Balance desired skill-sets

When balancing creative roles which require both soft and technical skill-sets, be careful how these expectations are communicated and how projects are assigned. This is when things can get lopsided very quickly if it's ignored (example: one group assigned to communication heavy work while others are given technical projects which allow them to be promoted faster).

## Doing Better, Together

I've been talking about my work at Shopify around diversity a lot because it was a big learning curve for me. Since then, I've received questions about how someone can help move the needle. Below I've outlined a few ways someone can affect change at different levels:

### At the company level

A clear and consistent message must come from upper management or it won't gain the traction it needs. Change management needs to happen both from a top-down perspective and a bottom-up perspective. Frequent company discussions about diversity and inclusion can help alleviate the education needs for individual managers. Mentioning it as a dimension the company is actively trying to improve and highlighting work on it helps further reinforce the idea.

Lastly, don't make this work the sole responsibility of PoC and minorities.<a id="anchor-1" href="#note-1" class="fieldnotes-anchor">[1]</a>

### At the manager level

Most managers participate in hiring, interviewing, and recognition activities. I found that I was much more effective, too, the more I read about it so it was easier for me to navigate certain conversations about the topic. If I did it again, I would have spent more time asking for help to speed up my learning. 

### As an individual contributor

ICs tend to have a lot more power than they realize through peer influence. Educating those around you about the issues helps alleviate burdens for everyone. In group settings, be particularly mindful of who is speaking and taking space. When an opportunity comes up which may not help you, but would help someone else, consider suggesting them as the person on the project. Lastly, if you see someone doing well, praise your colleague and let their manager know.

### As a member in the tech industry

I would be irresponsible to not point out that tech culture _as a whole_ tends to have a lot of influence on a company as well. Again, education and open discussion about the topic helps others learn more about the problem you're trying to solve. To help discourage active retaliation, be clear about what you will and will not tolerate in the community you're apart of by being verbal, reinforcing and using conduct codes, and calling things out when things appear unfair.

Strategies on how to deal with social inequality vary but progress tends to be made only when the participation is _active._ Ignoring a social problem never makes it go away so we all have to do our part.

## Results

I worked on a few of these changes over the course of six months. While progress felt slow and frustrating, we did make some progress. The dimension which changed the most was the binary gender dimension with small improvements in a couple of others.<a id="anchor-2" href="#note-2" class="fieldnotes-anchor">[2]</a> Admittedly, I wasn't there long enough to gauge long-term success and can only speak to what happened within a small sub-set of employees.

My overall hope was that my actions would encourage others to participate too in improving the overall numbers and help the initiatives at Shopify (of which there are many, much credit owed to the team). It was the first time I tried to affect change at a larger scale like this and the approach I took could have used some tinkering. I fluffed more features than I think was necessary but it's impossible to say what would have happened had I not fluffed.

There is likely more I haven't covered here however I've included a list of resources below which may help start your research into the area too if you're looking at this type of work in your company.<a id="anchor-3" href="#note-3" class="fieldnotes-anchor">[3]</a>

## Resources

Here's a start on things that can be helpful in navigating this time for you. Granted a lot of these things are women-focused as that was the dimension I looked at:

- <a href="http://www.paulaprinciple.com/">The Paula Principle</a> is a decent first step into the world of women in tech
- <a href="https://www.changetogether.io/">Change Together</a> by TechGirlsCan and TWG (an agency in Toronto, Canada) published a short book on what they learned over a collaborative 12 month study
- <a href="https://www.hiremorewomenintech.com/">HireMoreWomeninTech.com</a> for more ideas on how to affect change
- Twitter is a great way to find people who also talk about the same thing: I learned a lot from: <a href="https://twitter.com/shaft">Leslie Miley</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/triketora">Tracy Chou</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/robynkanner">Robyn Kanner</a>, and many others.

    <p id="note-1"><a href="#anchor-1" class="footnote-back">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a> <span class="footnote">[1]</span> This is a good summary of why leadership should be active reinforcing this: Stefanie K. Johnson and David R. Hekman, <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/03/women-and-minorities-are-penalized-for-promoting-diversity" class="external" target="_blank">&#8220;<span class="external-body"><em>Women and Minorities Are Penalized for Promoting Diversity</em></span>&#8221; <span class="external-box"><span class="external-box__arrow">↗&#xFE0E;</span></span></a>, 3/23/2016</p>

    <p id="note-2"><a href="#anchor-2" class="footnote-back">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a> <span class="footnote">[2]</span> I have received criticism that I have been biased towards the bi-gender dimension in the past. I don't deny this. My own gender was how I noticed that this system was off-balance so I spent a lot of time learning about that. I plan to become a better advocate for other minorities in the future.</p>

    <p id="note-3"><a href="#anchor-3" class="footnote-back">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a> <span class="footnote">[3]</span> In the interest of honesty: I don't believe major strides can be made in diversity _unless_ it's heavily reinforced by the executive team. Tech culture is too unhealthy and has too much influence over how individual workers act. While we did make progress and I was happy to have found a couple of true allies, I found that the biggest issues were laziness, apathy, and my own personal exhaustion. I was assured by the fact that non-diverse companies tend to breed environments of incompetance and under-perform but I am not one to sit by and not do anything. Overall, the biggest insight that I can take home from this experience is: you can always trust someone's actions. There's way too much lip service in the tech industry. This is critical and cynical but that's kind of how the topic is sitting with me these days after this experience.</p>
