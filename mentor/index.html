							<h6>Hired Helen to build a portfolio with him</h6>
							<p>While she does have the answers for many things related to design and front-end development this wasn’t her goal. Motivating me to learn how to come to the answer was the goal. This approach helped instill intuitive characteristics that I needed to complete the next design or coding challenge.</p>
							<p>She truly cares about the success of her students. I’m happy that she pushed me to produce better work than I could have on my own during my bright beginnings. Highly recommend.</p>

							<h6>Hired Helen to HELP HER switch from print design to product design</h6>
							<p>She was an amazing mentor, guiding me through my projects and always providing clear, specific, and thoughtful feedback. She has endless patience for her students and never made me feel uncomfortable about my work or asking for feedback. She taught me front-end development through pair programming and product design principles for iOS/Android and responsive web.</p>
							<p>More importantly, she taught me how to be confident about myself as a Designer and to really challenge myself to be better. I really credit her mentorship to my being able to make a career transition to Product Design. Even now when I work on client projects I think to myself, "What would Helen say about this?</p>

							<h6>Hired Helen to finesse Design skills of a front-end developer</h6>
							<p>Being largely self taught [...] when I missed out on a job opportunity to someone who was "more polished" that I realized it was time to invest in my career and look for an opportunity to improve through a mentorship.</p>
							<p>After our initial interview I was confident that Helen's vast experience in design both from an educational and professional standpoint would be the perfect fit for the growth I was looking for.</p>
							<p>Helen spends the time necessary to ensure that I understand concepts thoroughly but doesn't just hand me the answer which is hugely beneficial. I'm expected to work and she has the experience to know when to step in and guide and when to step back and let me figure things out. It's both challenging and rewarding which is exactly what a mentorship should be.</p>
